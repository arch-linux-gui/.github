# ALG

ALG (formerly Arch Linux GUI), is a fast, offline, graphical installer for Arch Linux. It was discontinued in the month of July 2022, after a final [release](https://github.com/arch-linux-gui/alg-releases/releases/tag/v2022.07). We are working to update the repositories to the latest standards so that builders can build ISOs error free.
