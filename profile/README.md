# ALG

ALG (formerly Arch Linux GUI), is a fast, offline, graphical installer for Arch Linux. We are working to update the repositories to the latest standards so that builders can build ISOs error free.

### Update as of October 2024.
ALG is back, kind of. We have had one release, focusing on providing users with a new ISO. The new website, forum, and other utilities are still in developement.
